 Streaming+: A Personalized Twitch Resources Recommendation Engine                           Built web pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to search Twitch resources and get recommendations. Created Java servlets with RESTful APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses. Used MySQL to store user preferences (favored videos etc.) and deployed to Amazon RDS for better simplicity and scalability.
